## BMI

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement unit of a Person's mass.
BMI can be calculated using a person's weight divided by the square of the person's height (Kilogram/Meters^2).
             
BMI can be used for a health screnning, as high BMI can indicate high amount of fat in the body. A normal BMI range should be between 18.5-25,
where anything under can be considered as underweight, while anything above can be considered as overweight/obese.

**From the Charts above, It shows that people with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) have a higher BMI number overall.
Having a BMI in the normal range is one of the best way of to reduce the risk of CAD.**
